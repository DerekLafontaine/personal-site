   <h2> Family man, Car Enthusiast, Developer</h2>
   <p>I'm 38 and starting my new adventure in developing! It's been fun but also has been very challenging!</p>
   <h3>After being laid off from the Covid pandemic, I went to work for Union Pacfic Railroad. The hours and lifestyle did not fit my personal life. So I decided to take on FullStack and here I am!</h3>
   <p>I want to be the best developer that I can be and hope that with the help of my instuctors and cohort, I will be successful.</p>
